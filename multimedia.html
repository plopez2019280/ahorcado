  <pre>
First I go whip out the boat
No, I can't hit on no breaks
My life is out of control
I'm tellin' you, nobody safe

I've been livin' my life limbo
My ice, it came with a tray
It's so hot, I gotta hide my face
This not a rockstar phase
I'm a emo, thuggin' my phase

Zero, zero, zero, zero
Tell her to come chase
Monkey nuts, hold me
Baby, I got on two chains

Roll another blunt and I might motherf*ckin' faint
Spin on the block, have a pu$$y ni**a stained
I just put on my boots, ain't worried 'bout no rain
Put a ni**a down, Channel 2 front page
You was just askin' for some change, now you changed?
Yeah, I told you, yeah, about that money, sh1tt get strange

Fully loaded check, hold up
Baby, Jordan paid
I put duct tape on my switch
Perfect aim
They can't put me in no genre baby
Cause I changed the game
We f*ckin' on the same h0e
But we not the same

Disrespect the 5, I put your a$ in the food chain
B1tch keep callin' my phone
She sayin' Ms. Jackson goin' through her brain 
We was just outside dancin', movin' on molly, feelin' insane

I f*cked the b1tch so nasty
We go Sephora then we go PINK
She not so f*ckin' toxic
And she care about what I think

She's nothin' like no other b1tches
She care about what I drink
I think she's a fling
I think she's a play maker
She should be on my team
She should get her a ring
Sh1tt, it can't be me
But she could be on the team
Diamonds they come out the water
My sock, it come with a ring
The Wraith came  with a chauffer
The chauffer ready to take me
